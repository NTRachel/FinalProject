# FinalProject

I thought that this game would be pretty simple, we would only need to write a function for the player, the shooting, and the enemies. But there was more to account for such as the bullets actually shooting from the player, collisions of the bullets hitting the enemies and killing them, and collisions of the player and the enemies. It was difficult to account for all these things in a program that we just learned. It's like we knew what we wanted to do, we just didn't know how to actually make it happen. I did learn how love works in general, with the three different functions, love.load(), love.update(), and love.draw(). If there was more time I think we would eventually finish everything we wanted to do. It was fun and exciting when I was able to figure how the code corresponds to the player's movement, I felt like I understood the code and was able to see it in action. It was also fun to design the sprites! I just wish I was able to use all of them.
